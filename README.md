# Employee-Payroll-Tracker
This is a mock payroll management application that allows the user to add and view an employee's payroll data.

### My thoughts and How I Approached This Challenge (I have comments in the code that also show my approach)
* This project really pushed my knowledge of what I've learned so far in this course. 
* I spent at least 75% of my time googling so that I could find pieces that I could put together in order to make this work.
* A place that helped me a lot was freeCodeCamp.org. This page explained to me how the class declaration can establish objects which I used for the the first/last names and salary.
* Another thing that helped me was constantly referring to the class activities. Both the student and instructor versions. They already have examples of for loops, functions, methods, etc. that I used as guidance for this challenge.
